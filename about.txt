ABOUT
=====

The Fantasy Game Creation Kit aims to become exactly what the name
suggests: a game creation kit that encapsulates all the basic tools
necessary for creating simple games quickly.
This kit has sprite editor, and geometry and strings API implemented.
Other planned tools include:
- a map editor,
- a sounds editor,
- a code editor (maybe).

Please note that only a limited API is supported right now.

The kit is implemented on top of Love2D. It is also heavily inspired
by fantasy consoles like PICO-8 and TIC-80. That said, it is not
going to be a fantasy console sensu stricto: the planned limitations
are not very strict, and this kit is not going to use a virtual
machine or simulate hardware.

"A framework designed to make a retro games" describes Fantasy
Game Creation Kit more accurately.

GETTING STARTED
===============

Game is shipped with various start scripts:
- `start` script runs `_cart.lua` file
- `sprites` script runs sprite editor.

The main functions (Init, Input, Update, Draw) need to
be specified in the `_cart.lua` file.

In v0.2, the following features and API functions are present:
- text manipulation
- geometry drawing
- sprites drawing
- sprite editor

To get a sense of how the kit works, it is recommended to check
the examples included in the main archive. To use them,
you need to replace the original `_cart.lua` with one copied
from the examples directory.
