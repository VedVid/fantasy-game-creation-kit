ABOUT
=====

Fantasy Game Creation Kit aims to be exactly what the name suggests:
game creation kit that encapsulates all basic tools necessary for
creating simple games fast:
- sprites editor,
- map editor,
- sounds editor,
- code editor (maybe).

It is implemented at the top of Love2D. Also, it is heavily inspired by fantasy consoles like PICO-8 and TIC-80.
Some of the limitations specific to true fantasy consoles are
already implemented, or will be implemented in the future.
In contrast to the majority of fantasy consoles, the limitations
are not as strict, and this kit might be easily extended by calling
Love2D functions directly or by using 3rd-party libraries.

Fantasy Game Creation Kit is not going to use virtual machine or
simulate hardware like CPU, RAM, GPU.


SPECIFICATIONS
==============

Display: 256x192 (AR 4:3)
Palette: 16 colour palette, extensions are possible
Input  : (planned) 4 directional keys, 4 action keys, 2 special keys

Code   : Lua; there is planned support for other languages that
             compile to Lua, like Moonscript


GETTING STARTED
===============

Currently, games made with this kit needs to be ran like normal
Love2D games: by dragging-and-dropping kit folder over the Love2D
executable.

The main functions (Init, Input, Update, Draw) need to
be specified in _cart.lua file.

In v0.1, the only implemented API functions are these related to
the text, geometry drawing, and input handling.
