ABOUT
=====

The Fantasy Game Creation Kit aims to become exactly what the name
suggests: a game creation kit that encapsulates all the basic tools
necessary for creating simple games quickly.
This kit has sprite editor, and geometry and strings API implemented.
Other planned tools include:
- a map editor,
- a sounds editor,
- a code editor (maybe).

Please note that only a limited API is supported right now.

The kit is implemented on top of Love2D. It is also heavily inspired
by fantasy consoles like PICO-8 and TIC-80. That said, it is not
going to be a fantasy console sensu stricto: the planned limitations
are not very strict, and this kit is not going to use a virtual
machine or simulate hardware.

"A framework designed to make a retro games" describes Fantasy
Game Creation Kit more accurately.


SPECIFICATIONS
==============

Display: 256x192 (AR 4:3)
Palette: 16 colour palette, extensions are possible
Input  : (planned) 4 directional keys, 4 action keys, 2 special keys
Sprites: 512 sprites
Map    : To be decided
Sound  : To be decided
Code   : Lua; there is planned support for other languages that
             compile to Lua, like Moonscript


GETTING STARTED
===============

Game is shipped with various start scripts:
- `start` script runs `_cart.lua` file
- `sprites` script runs sprite editor.

The main functions (Init, Input, Update, Draw) need to
be specified in the `_cart.lua` file.

In v0.2, the following features and API functions are present:
- text manipulation
- geometry drawing
- sprites drawing
- sprite editor

To get a sense of how the kit works, it is recommended to check
the examples included in the main archive. To use them,
you need to replace the original `_cart.lua` with one copied
from the examples directory.


HOW DO I...
===========

Start playing game?
  Ensure that the correct _cart file is present in the fantasy_console
  directory and start the game by using `start` bat file.

Edit game's code?
  Use your favorite text editor to edit _cart file. You can also
  add your own files and libraries.
  Code editor is not part of the Fantasy Game Creation Kit,
  and I did not make my mind if I am going to implement it yet.

Edit sprites?
  Start sprite editor by using `sprites` bat file.

Run tests?
  Start test runner by running the `start_tests_` bat file.
  It will print the output to the console. If you wish to save output
  to the text file, simply stream the output to desired file by
  `start_tests > results.txt`.
  You need to have Lua 5.1 in your path to run the tests
  successfully.

Turn the console window on / off?
  Set `t.console` in `conf.lua` file to `true` or `false`.
