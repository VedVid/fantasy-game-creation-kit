ABOUT
=====

The Fantasy Game Creation Kit aims to become exactly what the name suggests: a game creation kit that encapsulates all the basic tools necessary for creating simple games quickly.
The planned tools include:
- a sprites editor,
- a map editor,
- a sounds editor,
- a code editor (maybe).

Please note that only a limited API is supported right now, and none of the editors are implemented yet.

The kit is implemented on top of Love2D. It is also heavily inspired
by fantasy consoles like PICO-8 and TIC-80. That said, it is not
going to be a fantasy console sensu stricto: the planned limitations
are not very strict, and this kit is not going to use a virtual
machine or simulate hardware.

"A framework designed to make a retro games" describes Fantasy
Game Creation Kit more accurately.

GETTING STARTED
===============

Currently, games made with this kit need to be run like normal
Love2D games: by dragging and dropping the kit folder over
the Love2D executable.

The main functions (Init, Input, Update, Draw) need to
be specified in the `_cart.lua` file.

In v0.1, the only implemented API functions are those related
to text, geometry drawing, and input handling.
